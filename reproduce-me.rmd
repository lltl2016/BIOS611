# Linear Regression

## Assumptions

Standard analysis of linear regression is based on the following four assumptions:

1. Linear relation with fixed regressors

2. Independence

3. Constant variance

4. Mean zero error

These assumptions can be succinctly written as: $Yi=X^{T}_{i} β+ϵ_i$, $ϵ_i∼iidD(0,2)$.


# Example

Using `mtcars` dataset, we fit a linear regression in `R`.

```{r}
out = lm(mpg ~ disp + wt, data = mtcars)
```

```{r,echo=FALSE}
library(knitr)
kable(summary(out)$coef,digits = 2, caption = "Regression table")
```

The variable `wt` has statistically significant association with `mpg`.

Next, we present the residual plot.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(out, which = 1)
```

residual plot
