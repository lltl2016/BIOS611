"1",2,"University of Washington","Designing for impact: identifying stakeholder-driven interventions to supportrecovery after major cancer surgery.","PURPOSE: Complex bladder and colorectal cancer surgeries are associated withsignificant patient morbidity, yet few resources exist to prepare patients forthe high levels of distress and complications they may experience. Afterethnographic research to identify design challenges, we held a user-centereddesign (UCD) workshop to begin to develop patient- and caregiver-centeredinterventions to support preparation for and recovery after complex cancersurgery.METHODS: Concepts that emerged from brainstorming sessions were visuallyrepresented on storyboards and rated. Highly scored concepts were furtherdeveloped in break-out prototyping sessions and then presented to the entiregroup for review in person and during subsequent webinars. We collected workshopproducts (worksheets, prototypes, and recordings) for analysis to identifyopportunities for intervention. The workshop, held in late , was attended bythree colorectal/oncologic surgeons, three urologic surgeons, five ostomy nurses,one quality improvement leader, three patients, one caregiver, and threeexperienced UCD facilitators.RESULTS: Three opportunity areas were identified: () enhanced patient educationincluding tele-health and multi-media tools (available at hospitals/clinics oronline in any setting), () personalized discharge assessment and care planning,and () integrated symptom monitoring and educational interventions. Stakeholdersreached consensus that enhanced patient education was the most importantdirection for subsequent intervention development.CONCLUSIONS: We engaged diverse stakeholders in a participatory, UCD process andconcluded that research and practice improvement should prioritize thedevelopment of educational interventions in the pre-operative period to set thegroundwork for improving appropriate self-care during recovery from majorcolorectal and bladder cancer surgeries."
"2",1,"University of Chicago","Systematic Review of the Impact of Cancer Survivorship Care Plans on HealthOutcomes and Health Care Delivery.","Purpose Numerous organizations recommend that patients with cancer receive asurvivorship care plan (SCP) comprising a treatment summary and follow-up careplans. Among current barriers to implementation are providers' concerns about thestrength of evidence that SCPs improve outcomes. This systematic review evaluateswhether delivery of SCPs has a positive impact on health outcomes and health caredelivery for cancer survivors. Methods Randomized and nonrandomized studiesevaluating patient-reported outcomes, health care use, and disease outcomes afterdelivery of SCPs were identified by searching MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO,Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, and Cochrane Library.Data extracted by independent raters were summarized on the basis of qualitativesynthesis. Results Eleven nonrandomized and  randomized studies met inclusioncriteria. Variability was evident across studies in cancer types, SCP deliverytiming and method, SCP recipients and content, SCP-related counseling, andoutcomes assessed. Nonrandomized study findings yielded descriptive informationon satisfaction with care and reactions to SCPs. Randomized study findings weregenerally negative for the most commonly assessed outcomes (ie, physical,functional, and psychological well-being); findings were positive in singlestudies for other outcomes, including amount of information received,satisfaction with care, and physician implementation of recommended care.Conclusion Existing research provides little evidence that SCPs improve healthoutcomes and health care delivery. Possible explanations include heterogeneity instudy designs and the low likelihood that SCP delivery alone would influencedistal outcomes. Findings are limited but more positive for proximal outcomes(eg, information received) and for care delivery, particularly when SCPs areaccompanied by counseling to prepare survivors for future clinical encounters.Recommendations for future research include focusing to a greater extent onevaluating ways to ensure SCP recommendations are subsequently acted on as partof ongoing care."

We also investigated the clinical significance of CTCs and their kineticprofiles in patients with cancer undergoing radiotherapy treatment.ExperimentalDesign: Patients with histologically confirmed primary carcinoma undergoingradiotherapy, with or without chemotherapy, were eligible for enrollment.Peripheral blood was collected prospectively at up to five time points, includingbefore radiotherapy, at the first week, mid-point and final week of treatment, aswell as  to  weeks after completion of radiotherapy. CTC capture wasaccomplished using a nanotechnology-based assay (CapioCyte) functionalized withaEpCAM, aHER-, and aEGFR.Results: CapioCyte was able to detect CTCs in all cancer patients enrolled. Multivalent binding via poly(amidoamine) dendrimersfurther improved capture sensitivity. We also showed that cell rolling effect canimprove CTC capture specificity (% of captured cells that are CK+/CD-/DAPI+) upto %. Among the  patients with sequential CTC measurements, the median CTCdecreased from  CTCs/mL before radiotherapy to  CTCs/mL at completion ofradiotherapy (P = .). CTCs declined throughout radiotherapy in patients withcomplete clinical and/or radiographic response, in contrast with an elevation inCTCs at mid or post-radiotherapy in the two patients with known pathologicresidual disease.Conclusions: Our study demonstrated that multivalent binding andcell rolling can improve the sensitivity and specificity of CTC capture comparedwith multivalent binding alone, allowing reliable monitoring of CTC changesduring and after treatment.

"4",2,"University of Chicago","What Happened to Disparities in CRC Screening Among FFS Medicare EnrolleesFollowing Medicare Modernization?","The Medicare Modernization Act of , implemented in , increased managedcare options for seniors. It introduced insurance plans for prescription drugcoverage for all Medicare beneficiaries, whether they were enrolled in FFS ormanaged care (Medicare Advantage) plans. The availability of drug coveragebeginning in  served to free up budgets for FFS Medicare enrollees that couldbe used to make copayments for colorectal cancer (CRC) screening using endoscopy(colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy). In , Medicare eliminated the copaymentsrequired by seniors for CRC screening by endoscopy. Later in , CRC screeningby colonoscopy became part of the gold standard for CRC screening. Thislegitimized its use and offered even further encouragement to seniors, who mayhave been reluctant to undergo the procedure because of the non-pecuniary risksassociated with it. In addition,  CRC screening interventions occurred duringthis timeframe to enhance compliance with screening standards. Using multilevelanalysis of individuals' endoscopy utilization, derived from % FFS Medicareclaims, along with county-level market and contextual factors, we compare theperiods before and after the MMA (- to -) to determine whetherdisparities in the utilization of endoscopic CRC screening occurred or changedover the decade. We examined Blacks, Asians, and Hispanics relative to Whites,and Females relative to Males (with race or ethnicity combined). We examined eachstate separately for evidence of disparities within states, to avoid confoundingby geographic disparities. We expected that the net effect of the policy changesand the targeted interventions over the decade would be to increase CRC screeningby endoscopy, reducing disparities. We saw improvements over time (reduceddisparities relative to Whites) for Blacks and Hispanics residing in severalstates, and improvements over time for Females relative to Males in many states.For the vast majority of states, however, disparities persisted with Whites andMales exhibiting greater rates of utilization than other groups. States thatundertook the interventions were more likely to have had improvements indisparities or positive disparities for women and minorities. While some gainswere made over this time period, the gains were unevenly distributed across theUSA and more work needs to be done to reduce remaining disparities."

This has been largely attributed to chemotherapy-inducedimpairment of innate immunity, such as neutropenia, whereas systemic effects oftumors on hematopoiesis and adoptive immunity remain incompletely understood.Here we observed anemia associated with severe deficiency of CD+ T cellresponses against pathogens in treatment-naive mice bearing large tumors.Specifically, we identify CD+ erythroid progenitor cells (CD+TER+; EPCs)as robust immunosuppressors. CD+ EPCs, induced by tumor growth-associatedextramedullary hematopoiesis, accumulate in the spleen to become a majorpopulation, outnumbering regulatory T cells (Tregs) and myeloid-derivedsuppressor cells (MDSCs). The CD+ EPC transcriptome closely resembles that ofMDSCs, and, like MDSCs, reactive oxygen species production is a major mechanismunderlying CD+ EPC-mediated immunosuppression. Similarly, an immunosuppressiveCD+ EPC population was detected in patients with cancer who have anemia. Thesefindings identify a major population of immunosuppressive cells that likelycontributes to the impaired T cell responses commonly observed in patients withadvanced cancer."

However, intraindividual variability in epithelialinvolution status within a woman is undefined. We developed a novel measure ofage-related epithelial involution, density of epithelial nuclei in epithelialareas using digital image analysis in combination with stromal characteristics(percentage of section area comprising stroma). Approximately  hematoxylinand eosin stained sections of benign breast tissue were evaluated from participants having breast surgery for cancer or benign conditions. Two tosixteen slides per woman from different regions of the breast were studied.Epithelial involution status varied within a woman and as a function of stromalarea. Percentage stromal area varied between samples from the same woman (mediandifference between highest and lowest stromal area within a woman was .%, butranged from . to .%). Restricting to women with at least % stromal area(Nâ=â), epithelial nuclear density decreased with age (-. cells/mm perdecade of life after age , pâ<â.), increased with mammographic density(. cells/mm per increasing BI-RADs density category pâ=â.), andincreased non-significantly with recent parity, later age at first pregnancy, andlonger and more recent oral contraceptive use. These associations were attenuatedin women with mostly fat samples (<% stroma (Nâ=â)). Thirty-one percent ofwomen evaluated had both adequate stroma (â¥%) and mostly fat (<% stroma)regions of breast tissue, with the probability of having both types increasingwith the number breast tissue samplings. Several breast cancer risk factors areassociated with elevated age-related epithelial content, but associations dependupon stromal context. Stromal characteristics appear to modify relationshipsbetween risk factor exposures and breast epithelial involution."

This prospective,hypothesis-generating pilot study investigates the relationship between interimPET imaging during CRT for anal canal cancer and clinical outcome.METHODS AND MATERIALS: From June  to August ,  patients with anal canalcancer were enrolled in a prospective clinical study of PET prior to and duringCRT after â¼Â Gy. PET parameters of the primary site included maximumstandardized uptake value (SUVmax), metabolic tumor volume (MTV), and totallesion glycolysis (TLG). MTV and TLG were calculated based on % SUVmax (MTV,TLG) orÂ SUV . (MTV., TLG.) thresholds for pretreatment and interimimages. Absolute and change in PET parameters were assessed for association withfreedom from local and regional recurrence (FFLR) using single-predictor Coxregression models. Local and regional recurrence were primary and nodal(in-field) recurrences, respectively.RESULTS: Twenty-three patients were eligible for analysis. Patients were excludedwith nonsquamous cell histology, recurrent anal cancer, and incomplete studiesdue to treatment toxicity or patient choice. Median follow-up was .Â years.Pretreatment MTV (HR . [% CI .-.]), interim MTV. (. [.-.]),and interim TLG. (. [.-.]) were associated with FFLR.CONCLUSIONS: In this prospective pilot study, interim PET parameters wereassociated with FFLR. These results warrant further investigation assessing thevalue of interim PET as a biomarker of response in the treatment of patients withanal cancer."

Patients weretreated with nab-paclitaxel â¯mg/m, CbP area under the curve (AUC)  and Câ¯mg/m week  then â¯mg/m for six weeks, followed by standard of carechemoradiotherapy (CRT). The primary endpoint was clinical response rate toinduction therapy as defined by RECIST version .. Secondary measures includedtoxicity, progression-free survival, overall survival and quality of life asmeasured by FACT-HN.RESULTS:  eligible subjects were treated. Primary sites were: oropharynx (OPX)(), larynx () oral cavity (OC) (), hypopharynx (). The most common grade or  toxicity during induction was acneiform rash (%) followed by neutropenia(%). RR was .%. Median PFS and OS have not been reached (median follow-up of.â¯years); they were superior in patients with response.CONCLUSIONS: The combination of nab-paclitaxel, CbP and C is feasible,tolerable and active against locally advanced SCCHN."

We used standard case-control logistic regression to test forgene-environment interactions.RESULTS: For EA, rs at chromosome p., near the RNFA-LOCgene, showed a borderline significant interaction with smoking status (P =.Ã-). Ever smoking was associated with an almost -fold increase in riskof EA among individuals with rs-AA genotype (odds ratio=.; % CI,.-.). Three SNPs (rs, rs, rs) at chromosome q.,near the RND-RBM gene, interacted with GERD symptoms (P = .Ã-, P =.Ã-, and P = .Ã-, respectively) to affect risk of EA. For BE,rs at chromosome p., near the EIFC gene, and rs at chromosomeq, at the SLCA gene, interacted with BMI (P = .Ã-) and pack-years ofsmoking history (P = .Ã-), respectively.CONCLUSION: The associations of BMI, smoking, and GERD symptoms with risks of EAand BE appear to varyÂ with SNPs at chromosomes , , and . Validation of thesesuggestive interactions isÂ warranted."

For women who developbreast cancer early, the genetic architecture is less established.Methods: Toidentify loci associated with early-onset breast cancer, gene-based tests werecarried out using exome array data from , women with breast cancer diagnosedbefore age  and  age-matched controls. Replication was undertaken in apopulation that developed breast cancer at all ages of onset.Results: Three generegions were associated with breast cancer incidence: FGFR (P = . Ã -;replication P < .

Of the  generegions reported in previous literature,  (.%) showed evidence ofassociation (P < .) with the risk of early-onset breast cancer in theearly-onset population. To predict incidence, whole-genome prediction wasimplemented on a subset of , participants who were additionally genotyped ona genome wide array. The whole-genome prediction outperformed a polygenic riskscore [AUC, .; % confidence interval (CI), .-. compared with .;% CI, .-.], and when combined with known epidemiologic risk factors,the AUC rose to .

We assessed safety, pharmacokinetics, andantitumor activity of TRC in combination with axitinib in patients withmetastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC).SUBJECTS, MATERIALS, AND METHODS: Heavily pretreated mRCC patients were treatedwith TRC weekly ( mg/kg and then  mg/kg) in combination with axitinib(initially at  mg b.i.d. and then escalated per patient tolerance to a maximumof  mg b.i.d.) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity using astandard  +  phase I design.RESULTS: Eighteen patients (median number of prior therapies = ) were treated.TRC dose escalation proceeded to  mg/kg weekly without dose-limitingtoxicity. Adverse event characteristics of each drug were not increased infrequency or severity when the two drugs were administered concurrently. TRCand axitinib demonstrated preliminary evidence of activity, including partialresponses (PR) by RECIST in % of patients, and median progression-free survival(. months). None of the patients with PR had PR to prior first-line treatment.Lower baseline levels of osteopontin and higher baseline levels of TGF-Î² receptor correlated with overall response rate.CONCLUSION: TRC at  and  mg/kg weekly was well tolerated in combinationwith axitinib, with encouraging evidence of activity in patients with mRCC.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is associated with wastingof peripheral tissues, a metabolic syndrome that lowers quality of life and hasbeen proposed to decrease survival of patients with cancer,. Tissue wasting isa multifactorial disease and targeting specific circulating factors to reversethis syndrome has been mostly ineffective in the clinic,. Here we show thatloss of both adipose and muscle tissue occurs early in the development ofpancreatic cancer. Using mouse models of PDAC, we show that tumour growth in thepancreas but not in other sites leads to adipose tissue wasting, suggesting thattumour growth within the pancreatic environment contributes to this wastingphenotype. We find that decreased exocrine pancreatic function is a driver ofadipose tissue loss and that replacement of pancreatic enzymes attenuatesPDAC-associated wasting of peripheral tissues. Paradoxically, reversal of adiposetissue loss impairs survival in mice with PDAC. When analysing patients withPDAC, we find that depletion of adipose and skeletal muscle tissues at the timeof diagnosis is common, but is not associated with worse survival. Takentogether, these results provide an explanation for wasting of adipose tissue inearly PDAC and suggest that early loss of peripheral tissue associated withpancreatic cancer may not impair survival."

The  solicited PRO-CTCAE symptoms reflected all reportedradiation-induced toxicities with the exception of phlegm/mucus production andmouth/throat pain with swallowing in patients receiving head and neck radiation,eye dryness/irritation in patients undergoing brain radiation, and obstructiveurinary symptoms in men receiving pelvic radiation. The PRO-CTCAE items ""skinburns"" and ""pain"" require greater specificity to adequately reflect toxicitiesexperienced during radiation.CONCLUSIONS: PRO-CTCAE demonstrates strong content validity as a measure ofsymptomatic toxicities in patients receiving radiation. These results provideempirical support for the definition of site-specific PRO-CTCAE item sets toassess the symptomatic toxicities of radiation therapy. The site-specificPRO-CTCAE item sets developed herein are currently being deployed in ourdepartment via an electronic platform to capture treatment-related toxicity."

However, in cells with BP gene knockout (KO), BRCA isdispensable for the initiation of resection, but whether BRCA activity isentirely redundant after end resection is unclear. Here, we found that bp KOrescued the embryonic viability of a BrcaÎC/ÎC mouse model that harbors a stopcodon in the coiled-coil domain. However, BrcaÎC/ÎC;bp-/- mice weresusceptible to tumor formation, lacked Rad foci, and were sensitive to PARPinhibitor (PARPi) treatment, indicative of suboptimal HR. Furthermore, BRCAmutant cancer cell lines were dependent on truncated BRCA proteins that retainedthe ability to interact with PALB for BP KO induced RAD foci and PARPiresistance. Our data suggest that the overall efficiency of BP loss offunction induced HR may be BRCA mutation dependent. In the setting of BP KO,hypomorphic BRCA proteins are active downstream of end resection, promotingRAD loading and PARPi resistance."

These options are bestweighed in a process of shared decision-making with the patient's healthcareteam. Minority men experience disparities in prostate cancer outcomes, possiblydue in part to a lack of optimal communication during treatment selection.Decision aids facilitate shared decision-making, improve knowledge of treatmentoptions, may increase satisfaction with treatment choice, and likely facilitatelong-term quality of life.METHODS/DESIGN: This study will compare the effect of two evidence-based decisionaids on patient knowledge and on quality of life measured one year aftertreatment, oversampling minority men.

In this study we develop a consistenttuning parameter selection method for regularized Cox's proportional hazardsmodel with a diverging number of parameters. The tuning parameter is selected byminimizing the generalized information criterion.

Non-muscle-invasive bladdercancer survivors have unique chronic burdens including frequent recurrences,repeated surveillance cystoscopies and treatments, and the highest lifetimemedical cost per person among all cancers.OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to summarize studies assessing qualityof life (QOL) in NMIBC survivors.METHODS: The literature from January  to March  found in PubMed, CINAHL,and PsycINFO databases was reviewed systematically. Inclusion criteria were asfollows: () research about NMIBC survivors, () outcomes included QOL, ()original research article published in peer-reviewed journals, and () publishedin English.RESULTS: A total of  studies were included:  quantitative studies and mixed-methods study. Non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer survivors hadsignificantly lower QOL compared with the general population, especially infatigue, physical and role functioning, and mental health. Repeated transurethralresections and intravesical treatments were associated with impaired physicalfunction and mental health. Most NMIBC survivors had concerns of urinary andbowel problems and sexual function.CONCLUSION: Despite a good prognosis, NMIBC and its treatment have a significantimpact on QOL in survivors. The findings showed large burdens in NMIBC survivorsand suggest that further research is needed to better understand potentialopportunities to improve QOL in this population.IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Oncology nurses are in the critical position forassessing symptoms and concerns. Oncology nurses should pay special attention toNMIBC survivors who have unique symptoms and burden with the aim of improvingsurvivors' QOL."

While recent population based studies demonstrated astable incidence of locoregional prostate cancer, they categorized organconfined, extraprostatic and lymph node positive disease together. However, toour knowledge the contemporary incidence of prostate cancer with pelvic lymphnode metastases remains unknown.MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results)data from  to  to identify men diagnosed with prostate cancer. Weanalyzed trends in the age standardized prostate cancer incidence by stage. Theimpact of disease extent on mortality was assessed by adjusted Cox proportionalhazard analysis.RESULTS: During the study period the annual incidence of nonmetastatic prostatecancer decreased from ,. to ,. per million men (IR ., % CI.-., p <.) while the incidence of pelvic lymph node metastases increasedfrom . to . per million men (IR ., % CI .-., p <.). Theincidence of distant metastases in men  years old or older reached a nadir in compared to  (IR ., % CI .-., p <.) and it increased in compared to  (IR ., % CI .-., p <.). The risk of cancerspecific mortality significantly increased in men diagnosed with pelvic lymphnode metastases (HR ., % CI .-., p <.) and distant metastases (HR., % CI .-., p <.) compared to men with nonmetastatic disease.CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of pelvic lymph node metastases is increasingcoincident with a decline in the detection of localized disease.

The primaryendpoint was intracranial response rate (RR); secondary objectives were CNSclinical benefit rate (CBR), extracranial RR, time to progression (TTP), overallsurvival (OS), and targeted sequencing of tumors from enrolled patients. Atwo-stage design distinguished intracranial RR of % versus %.RESULTS:  patients were evaluable for toxicity,  for efficacy. IntracranialRR was % ( PR). CNS CBR at  mos was %; at  mos %. Median intracranial TTPwas . mos (% CI .-). OS was . mos (% CI .-.). Grade -toxicities included neutropenia (%), anemia (%), and stomatitis (%).Mutations in TP and PIKCA were common in BCBM. Mutations in the PIK/mTORpathway were not associated with response. ERBB amplification was higher in BCBMcompared to primary BC; ERBB amplification in the primary BC trended towardworse OS.CONCLUSION: While intracranial RR to ETV was low in HERâ+âBCBM patients,one-third achieved CNS CBR; TTP/OS was similar to historical control. No newtoxicity signals were observed. Further analysis of the genomic underpinnings ofBCBM to identify tractable prognostic and/or predictive biomarkers is warranted.CLINICAL TRIAL: (NCT)."

As a result, patients typically present withdysphagia, regurgitation and occasionally chest pain, pulmonary complication andmalnutrition. New diagnostic methodologies and therapeutic techniques have beenrecently added to the armamentarium for treating achalasia. With the aim to offerclinicians and patients an up-to-date framework for making informed decisions onthe management of this disease, the International Society for Diseases of theEsophagus Guidelines proposed and endorsed the Esophageal Achalasia Guidelines(I-GOAL). The guidelines were prepared according the Appraisal of Guidelines forResearch and Evaluation (AGREE-REX) tool, accredited for guideline production byNICE UK. A systematic literature search was performed and the quality of evidenceand the strength of recommendations were graded according to the Grading ofRecommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE). Given therelative rarity of this disease and the paucity of high-level evidence in theliterature, this process was integrated with a three-step process of anonymousvoting on each statement (DELPHI). Only statements with an approval rate >%were accepted in the guidelines. Fifty-one experts from  countries and representatives from patient support associations participated to thepreparations of the guidelines. These guidelines deal specifically with thefollowing achalasia issues: Diagnostic workup, Definition of the disease,Severity of presentation, Medical treatment, Botulinum Toxin injection, Pneumaticdilatation, POEM, Other endoscopic treatments, Laparoscopic myotomy, Definitionof recurrence, Follow up and risk of cancer, Management of end stage achalasia,Treatment options for failure, Achalasia in children, Achalasia secondary toChagas' disease."

Our study examinedwhether circulating mediators of inflammation and immune response differ by tumorEBV status. From a Latvian series of  gastric cancer cases, we measured plasmalevels of  immune-related proteins in the  patients with EBV-positive tumorsand  patients with EBV-negative tumors. Eight markers were statisticallysignificantly higher with tumor EBV positivity: chemokine C-C motif ligand (CCL) (Odds Ratio (OR) = .; p-trend = .), chemokine C-X-C motif ligand  (OR =.; p-trend = .), programmed death-ligand  (PD-L; OR = .; p-trend =.), interleukin (IL)- (OR = .; p-trend = .), CCL (OR = .; p-trend= .), CCL (OR = .; p-trend = .), IL-A (OR = .; p-trend = .)and CCL (OR = .; p-trend = .). Systemic responses to EBV-positive gastriccancer are characterized by alterations in chemokines and PD-L. Profiling ofthese molecules may enable non-invasive diagnosis of EBV status when tumor tissueis unavailable. Our findings provide theoretical justification for clinicalevaluations of immune checkpoint therapy for EBV-positive gastric cancer."

Wefind that intradermal cheek injection of miR- induces TRPA-depedent itch(scratching) without pain (wiping) in naive mice. Extracellular perfusion ofmiR- induces TRPA currents in both Trpa-expressing heterologous cells andnative sensory neurons through the core sequence GGGACCC. Computer simulationsreveal that the core sequence binds several residues at the extracellular S-Sloop of TRPA, which are critical for TRPA activation by miR- but not allylisothiocyanate. Intradermal inoculation of human Myla cells induces lymphoma andchronic itch in immune-deficient mice, associated with increased serum levels ofmiR-, secreted from cancer cells. Lymphoma-induced chronic itch is suppressedby miR- inhibitor and a blocking peptide that disrupts the miR-/TRPAinteraction. Our findings demonstrated an unconventional physiological role ofextracellular naked miRNAs as itch mediators and ion channel modulators."

Mammographically screened womendiagnosed with primary invasive breast cancer from  to  (n = ) wereidentified by linking the Carolina Breast Cancer Study and the CarolinaMammography Registry. Among women with a registry-identified screening mammogram to  months before diagnosis, cancers were classified as screen-detected (N =) or interval-detected (N = ). Using logistic regression, we examined theassociation of mode of detection with cancer characteristics (clinical, IHC, andgenomic), overall, and in analyses stratified on mammographic density and race.Interval cancer was associated with large tumors [> cm; OR, .; % confidenceinterval (CI), .-.], positive nodal status (OR, .; % CI, .-.), andtriple-negative subtype (OR, .; % CI, .-.). Interval cancers were morelikely to have non-Luminal A subtype (OR, .; % CI, .-.), whereasscreen-detected cancers tended to be more indolent (% had low risk ofrecurrence genomic scores; % were PAM Luminal A). When stratifying bymammographic density and race, associations between interval detection and poorprognostic features were similar by race and density status. Strong associationsbetween interval cancers and poor-prognosis genomic features (non-Luminal Asubtype and high risk of recurrence score) suggest that aggressive tumor biologyis an important contributor to interval cancer rates.

The frequency of surveillance is informed only by expert opinion. Weaimed to model the incidence of neoplastic recurrence, validate the model in anindependent cohort, and propose evidence-based surveillance intervals.METHODS: We collected data from the United States Radiofrequency AblationRegistry (US RFA, -) and the United Kingdom National Halo Registry (UKNHR, -) to build and validate models to predict the incidence ofneoplasia recurrence after initially successful RFA. We developed  categories ofrisk and modeled intervals to yield .% risk of recurrence with invasiveadenocarcinoma. We fit Cox proportional hazards models assessing discriminationby CÂ statistic and % confidence limits.RESULTS: The incidence of neoplastic recurrence was associated with most severehistologic grade before CEIM, age, endoscopic mucosal resection, sex, andbaseline BE segment length. In multivariate analysis, a model based solely onmost severe pre-CEIM histology predicted neoplastic recurrence with a C statisticof . (% confidence limit, .-.) in the US RFA registry. This modelalso performed well when we used data from the UK NHR. Our model divided patientsinto  risk groups based on baseline histologic grade: non-dysplastic BE;indefinite for dysplasia, low-grade dysplasia, and high-grade dysplasia; orintramucosal adenocarcinoma. For patients with low-grade dysplasia, we proposesurveillance endoscopy at  and  years after CEIM; for patients with high-gradedysplasia or intramucosal adenocarcinoma, we propose surveillance endoscopy at., ., and  year after CEIM, then annually.CONCLUSION: In analyses of data from the US RFA and UK NHR for BE, amuch-attenuated schedule of surveillance endoscopy would provide protection frominvasive adenocarcinoma.

Weexplored whether polyubiquitin chains have any nonprotein-related function. Usingin vitro pull-down assays with synthetic materials, we found that polyubiquitinchains with the Lys (K) linkage bound to DNA through a motif we called the""DNA-interacting patch"" (DIP), which is composed of the adjacent residues Thr,Lys, and Glu Upon DNA damage, the binding of K-linked polyubiquitin chainsto DNA enhanced the recruitment of repair factors through their interaction withan Ile patch in ubiquitin to facilitate DNA repair. Furthermore, experimentalor cancer patient-derived mutations within the DIP impaired the DNA bindingcapacity of ubiquitin and subsequently attenuated K-linked polyubiquitin chainaccumulation at sites of DNA damage, thereby resulting in defective DNA repairand increased cellular sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents. Our results thereforehighlight a critical physiological role for K-linked polyubiquitin chains inbinding to DNA to facilitate DNA damage repair."

Participants were recruited from the study's fourfield centers (Bronx, NY; Chicago, IL; Miami, FL; San Diego, CA) between February and June . Perceived risk and perceived efficacy were assessed withquestions drawn from the Health Interview National Trends Survey. More than halfof the sample endorsed perceived risk of cancer associated with the six evaluatedbehaviors, as well as general perceived efficacy for preventing cancer. Adjustedlogistic regression analyses demonstrated significant differences acrossHispanic/Latino background groups for perceived risk associated with highconsumption of alcohol and saturated fat, low consumption of fruits andvegetables, and insufficient exercise but not with smoking or low consumption offiber. Differences were also found for the belief, ""It seems like everythingcauses cancer"" but not for other perceived efficacy items. Perceived cancer riskand perceived efficacy for preventing cancer were neither independently norinteractively associated with engagement in cancer-related risk behaviors aftercontrolling for sociodemographic covariates. Results suggest that perceptions ofrisk and efficacy with regard to cancer vary across Hispanic/Latino backgroundgroups, and therefore background group differences should be considered inprevention efforts. Perceived risk and perceived efficacy were not related tocancer-related risk behaviors among Hispanics/Latinos. Further work is needed toevaluate determinants of cancer-related risk in this population."

Treating BL in SSA poses particular challenges.Although highly effective, high-intensity cytotoxic treatments used inresource-rich settings are usually not feasible, and lower-intensity continuousinfusion approaches are impractical. In this article, based on evidence from theregion, we review management strategies for SSA focused on diagnosis and use ofprephase and definitive treatment. Additionally, potentially better approachesfor risk stratification and individualized therapy are elaborated. Compared withhistorical very low-intensity approaches, the relative safety, feasibility, andoutcomes of regimens incorporating anthracyclines and/or high-dose systemicmethotrexate for this population are discussed, along with requirements toadminister such regimens safely. Finally, research priorities for BL in SSA areoutlined including novel therapies, to reduce the unacceptable gap in outcomesfor patients in SSA vs high-income countries (HICs).

We calculated mean monthly out-of-pocket payment for eachfill by patient. We then categorized oral oncolytics by their overall andprogression-free survival benefits for each FDA-approved indication, usingevidence from published studies. We assessed the relationship of survival benefitwith mean monthly out-of-pocket payment, adjusting for demographic and plancharacteristics.RESULTS: Our population included , patients aged - years (mean . [SD.]) with a cancer diagnosis who filled , prescriptions. The most commonlyrepresented oncolytics were imatinib (.% of fills), lenalidomide (.% offills), and dasatinib (.% of fills). Approximately .% of fills were fordrug-indication pairs with an overall survival benefit of + years. In adjustedanalyses, there was no clear pattern to suggest that out-of-pocket paymentsdiffered with drug indication-specific survival benefits. Drugs for indicationsproviding >  to  year of overall survival benefit were significantly morelikely to have a lower out-of-pocket payment versus those prescribed off-label,but there were no significant differences in out-of-pocket payments between drugsand associated indications in any other survival category versus drugs usedoff-label.CONCLUSIONS: Out-of-pocket payments for oral oncolytics were not clearly relatedto indication-specific value in commercially insured patients.

We examined multiple ESR fusions and foundthat two, both identified in advanced endocrine treatment-resistant disease,encoded stable and functional fusion proteins. In both examples, ESR-e>YAP andESR-e>PCDHX, ESR exons - were fused in frame to C-terminal sequences fromthe partner gene. Functional properties include estrogen-independent growth,constitutive expression of ER target genes, and anti-estrogen resistance. Bothfusions activate a metastasis-associated transcriptional program, induce cellularmotility, and promote the development of lung metastasis. ESR-e>YAP- andESR-e>PCDHX-induced growth remained sensitive to a CDK/ inhibitor, and apatient-derived xenograft (PDX) naturally expressing the ESR-e>YAP fusion wasalso responsive. Transcriptionally active ESR fusions therefore trigger bothendocrine therapy resistance and metastatic progression, explaining theassociation with fatal disease progression, although CDK/ inhibitor treatmentis predicted to be effective."

Massively parallel next-generation sequencing allows copynumber profiling with fine resolution. Such efforts, however, have met with mixedsuccesses, with setbacks arising partly from the lack of reliable analyticalmethods to meet the diverse and unique challenges arising from the myriadexperimental designs and study goals in genetic studies. In cancer genomics,detection of somatic copy number changes and profiling of allele-specific copynumber (ASCN) are complicated by experimental biases and artifacts as well asnormal cell contamination and cancer subclone admixture. Furthermore, carefulstatistical modeling is warranted to reconstruct tumor phylogeny by both somaticASCN changes and single nucleotide variants.

Lung adenocarcinoma (ADC) is the most prevalent subtype of NSCLC, withthe main oncogenic drivers being KRAS and epidermal growth factor receptor(EGFR). Whereas EGFR blockade has led to some success in lung ADC, effective KRASinhibition is lacking. KRAS-mutant ADCs are characterized by high levels ofgel-forming mucin expression, with the highest mucin levels corresponding toworse prognoses. Despite these well-recognized associations, little is knownabout roles for individual gel-forming mucins in ADC development causatively. Wehypothesized that MUCAC/Mucac, a mucin gene known to be commonly expressed inNSCLC, is crucial in KRAS/Kras-driven lung ADC. We found that MUCAC was asignificant determinant of poor prognosis, especially in patients withKRAS-mutant tumors. In addition, by using mice with lung ADC induced chemicallywith urethane or transgenically by mutant-Kras expression, we observedsignificantly reduced tumor development in animals lacking Mucac compared withcontrols.

Bladder mpMRI may bemost useful in patients with non-muscle-invasive cancers, in expediting radicaltreatment or for determining response to bladder-sparing approaches.PATIENT SUMMARY: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans for bladder cancer arebecoming more common and may provide accurate information that helps improvepatient care. Here, we describe a standardized reporting criterion for bladderMRI. This should improve communication between doctors and allow bettercomparisons between patients."

Identifying patients at risk can guide treatment efforts.METHODS: POWER  and  were randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,multinational phase III trials that studied  patients with lung cancer at thestart of chemotherapy; the studies' aim was to assess the efficacy of enobosarmon prevention and treatment of muscle loss. We performed a secondary analysisrestricted to the control group, using a cumulative logit model for ordinaloutcome to determine which baseline characteristics predicted physical andfunctional loss during chemotherapy.RESULTS: In all, % of patients had loss of lean body mass and % had loss ofstair climb power (SCP) at day  of treatment. Of the  patients who receivedplacebo,  with observable outcome and baseline covariates were included forlean body mass analysis and  for SCP analysis. More advanced disease predicteda higher probability of greater physical loss (ORÂ = .; % confidence interval[CI]: .-.). Three factors predicted higher probability of SCP loss: taxanechemotherapy (ORÂ = .; % CI: .-.), tobacco use before chemotherapy(ORÂ = ., % CI: .-.), and SCP at baseline (ORÂ = ., % CI:.-.). Higher body mass index was a protective factor for functional loss(ORÂ = .; % CI: .-.).

However, little isknown about Hispanic women's use of supportive medications, and whether usediffers depending on nativity (US- vs. foreign-born). This study's objectiveswere to examine patterns of supportive medication use and investigate potentialdifferences by ethnicity/nativity among women with breast cancer.METHODS: We used the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results data linked withMedicare claims to identify women diagnosed with incident breast cancer betweenJuly , , and December , . Supportive medication use (opioid pain andnon-opioid psychotropic medications) in the Â days after diagnosis was theprimary outcome. We categorized ethnicity/nativity as US-Born non-Hispanic,US-born Hispanic, foreign-born non-Hispanic, and foreign-born Hispanic. ModifiedPoisson models examined associations between ethnicity/nativity and medicationuse, adjusting for tumor, treatment, and demographic characteristics.RESULTS: We included , women, of whom % were US-born non-Hispanics, %US-born Hispanics, % foreign-born non-Hispanics, and % foreign-born Hispanics.Supportive medication use varied by ethnicity/nativity. Compared to US-bornnon-Hispanics, foreign-born Hispanics and non-Hispanics were % (% CI.-.) and % (% CI .-.) less likely to receive supportivemedications, respectively. US-born Hispanics were % (% CI .-.) morelikely to receive supportive medications. Observed differences persisted whenanalyses were limited to stage I-III breast cancer cases.CONCLUSIONS: This work highlights potential disparities in the pharmacologictreatment of psychosocial needs of foreign-born breast cancer patients. Futurestudies should explore if differences observed here are reflective of healthdisparities or differential patient preferences."

Higher odds of CRA wereobserved among individuals with an affected mother (ORâ=â.; %CIâ=â.-.) or sibling (ORâ=â.; % CIâ=â.-.) as compared with thosewithout, whereas no association was shown for individuals with an affectedfather. Odds of having a metachronous CRA increased with number of affected FDRs,with ORs (% CIs) of . (.-.) for one relative and . (.-.) fortwo or more. Younger age of diagnosis of a sibling was associated with higherodds of metachronous CRA, with ORs (% CIs) of . (.-.) for diagnosis at< years; . (.-.) for - years; and .

Strategies toovercome this primary challenge are largely required.Experimental Design: Wetested the effects of IL plus doxorubicin on T-cell penetration and efficacy insolid tumors in a murine lung cancer model, a murine breast carcinoma lungmetastasis model, and two human xenograft tumor models bearing large tumors (>mm).Results: Intriguingly, this simple approach increased the numbers, thedistribution, and the depth of penetration of infused CD+ T cells in thesetumors, including both TILs and CAR T cells. This combined treatment halted tumorprogression and significantly extended survival time. Studies of the underlyingmechanism revealed multiple effects. First, the combined treatment maintained thehigh ratios of immune-stimulatory receptors to immune-inhibitory receptors oninfiltrated CD+ T cells, reduced the accumulation of immunosuppressiveregulatory T cells, and enhanced the numbers of T-bet+ effector T cells in thetumors. Second, doxorubicin induced chemokines CXCL and CXCL, which mayattract NKGD+CD+ T cells to tumors, and this effect was boosted by IL-inducedIFNÎ³ accumulation in tumors, promoting the penetration of NKGD+CD+ Tcells.Conclusions: The deep penetration of infused T cells associated withcombined IL plus doxorubicin yielded striking therapeutic effects in murine andhuman xenograft solid tumors. This approach might broaden the application ofT-cell therapy to a wider range of solid tumors. Clin Cancer Res; ();-. Â© AACRSee related commentary by Berraondo et al., p. ."

However, it is unclear whether surveillance increases survivaltimes of patients with BE. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis toqualitatively and quantitatively examine evidence for the association ofendoscopic surveillance in patients with BE with survival and other outcomes.METHODS: We searched publication databases for studies reporting the effects ofendoscopic surveillance on mortality and other EAC-related outcomes. We reviewedrandomized controlled trials, case-control studies, studies comparing patientswith BE who received regular surveillance with those who did not receive regularsurveillance, and studies comparing outcomes of patientsÂ withsurveillance-detected EAC vs symptom-detected EACs. We performed a meta-analysisof surveillance studies to generate summary estimates using a random effectsmodel. The primary aim was to examine the association of BE surveillance onEAC-related mortality. Secondary aims were to examine the association of BEsurveillance with all-cause mortality and EAC stage at time of diagnosis.RESULTS: A single case-control study did not show any association betweensurveillance and EAC-related mortality. A meta-analysis of  cohort studies foundthat lower EAC-related and all-cause mortality were associated with regularsurveillance (relative risk, .; % CI, .-.; hazard ratio, .; % CI,.-.). Meta-analysis of  cohort studies showed lower EAC-related andall-cause mortality among patients with surveillance-detected EAC vssymptom-detected EAC (relative risk, .; % CI, .-.; hazard ratio, .;% CI, .-.). Lead- and length-time bias adjustment substantiallyattenuated/eliminatedÂ the observed benefits. Surveillance was associated withdetection of EAC at earlier stages. A randomized trial is underway to evaluatethe effectsÂ of endoscopic surveillance on mortality in patients with BE.CONCLUSIONS: In a systematic review and meta-analysis of the effects ofsurveillance in patients with BE, surveillance as currently performed wasassociated with detection of earlier-stage EAC and may provide a small survivalbenefit. However, the effects of confounding biases on these estimates are notfully defined and may completely or partially explain the observed differencesbetween surveyed and unsurveyed patients."

Identifying mHAs with high allelefrequency, tight binding affinity to common HLA molecules, and narrow tissuerestriction could enhance immunotherapy against leukemia. Genotyping and HLAallele data from  HLA-matched donor-recipient pairs (DRPs) werecomputationally analyzed to predict both class I and class II mHAs likely toinduce either GVL or GVHD. Roughly twice as many mHAs were predicted inHLA-matched unrelated donor (MUD) stem cell transplantation (SCT) compared withHLA-matched related transplants, an expected result given greater geneticdisparity in MUD SCT. Computational analysis predicted  of  previouslyidentified mHAs, with  minor antigen mismatches not being contained in thepatient cohort,  missed mHA resulting from a noncanonical translation of thepeptide antigen, and  case of poor binding prediction. A predicted peptideepitope derived from GRK, a protein expressed in acute myeloid leukemia andtestis, was confirmed by targeted differential ion mobility spectrometry-tandemmass spectrometry. T cells specific to UNC-GRK-V were identified by tetrameranalysis both in DRPs where a minor antigen mismatch was predicted and in DRPswhere the donor contained the allele encoding UNC-GRK-V, suggesting that thisantigen could be both an mHA and a cancer-testis antigen.

Data from reports,including size, location, and histology of polyps, were abstracted using avalidated natural language processing algorithm. SPDR was defined as theproportion of colonoscopies with â¥â serrated polyp (not including hyperplasticpolyps). Multivariable logistic regression was performed to determine endoscopistcharacteristics associated with serrated polyp detection.RESULTS: âA total of â colonoscopies were performed by  endoscopists whovaried with respect to specialty (â% were gastroenterologists), sex (â%female), years in practice (range â-â), and number of colonoscopies performedduring the study period (range â-â).

We evaluated TTF based on age.METHODS: Pooled analyses were conducted with first-line chemotherapy trials foradvanced NSCLC (CALGB , , and ). Comparisons among patients whowere  years and older and  years and older were performed for TTF (primaryendpoint), reasons for early chemotherapy cessation, grade + adverse events, andoverall survival.RESULTS: Among  patients,  (%) were older than  years of age. Onehundred forty-five older patients (% of this age cohort) completed all sixplanned chemotherapy cycles as did  (%) younger patients. Median TTF was .months (% confidence interval: .- .) in older patients and  months (%confidence interval: .-.) in younger patients; adjustment for performancestatus and stratification by chemotherapy by trial yielded no statisticallysignificant age-based difference in TTF. However, reasons for early chemotherapycessation differed between age groups (multivariate pÂ = .). Older patientswere less likely to discontinue from cancer progression (% versus %) and morelikely from toxicity or patient choice (% and %, respectively) compared toyounger patients (% and %, respectively). Older patients were more likely toexperience grade + adverse events (% versus %) with no statisticallysignificant difference in survival. An age cutpoint of + years showed nodifference in TTF, a lower trend of early cessation due to cancer progression,and somewhat shorter older patient survival.CONCLUSIONS: TTF was comparable between older and younger patients; butdifferent, age-based, and potentially modifiable reasons account for it."

We used gaschromatography/mass spectrometry to quantify  PCB congeners and metabolites ofpesticides DDT, chlordane, hexachlorocyclohexane, and hexachlorobenzene. PCBs andpesticide metabolites were evaluated individually and summed by degree ofchlorination and parent compound, respectively. Odds ratios (OR) and %confidence intervals (CI) were computed using conditional logistic regression perspecified increase in lipid-adjusted concentration. We additionally stratifiedanalyses by birth cohort (-, -, -).RESULTS: Increasing concentration of DDT metabolites (ORper â¯ng/g = .,%CI = .-.) was inversely associated with thyroid cancer. Associations forPCBs were null or in inverse direction. We observed interactions for total PCBs,moderately-chlorinated PCBs, and chlordane metabolites with birth cohort(pâ¯â¤â¯.).

Our objective was to determine the cost-effectiveness ofdifferent cervical cancer screening strategies among women with HIV in SouthAfrica.METHODS: We modified a mathematical model of HPV infection and cervical diseaseto reflect coinfection with HIV. The model was calibrated to epidemiologic datafrom HIV-infected women in South Africa. Clinical and economic data were drawnfrom in-country data sources. The model was used to project reductions in thelifetime risk of cervical cancer and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios(ICERs) of Pap and HPV DNA screening and management algorithms beginning at HIVdiagnosis, at -, -, or -year intervals. Strategies with an ICER below SouthAfrica's  per capita gross domestic product (US$) were considered""cost-effective.""RESULTS: HPV testing followed by treatment (test-and-treat) at -year intervalswas the most effective strategy that was also cost-effective, reducing lifetimecancer risk by .% with an ICER of US$ per year of life saved. Othercost-effective strategies included Pap (referral threshold: HSIL+) at -, -, and-year intervals, and HPV test-and-treat at -year intervals.

In this analysis of  newly diagnosed SCCHN patients and cancer-free controls, we investigated whether expression levels of eight core NERproteins were associated with risk of SCCHN. We quantified NER protein expressionlevels in cultured peripheral lymphocytes using a reverse-phase proteinmicroarray. Compared with the controls, SCCHN patients had statisticallysignificantly lower expression levels of ERCC and XPA (Pâ=â. and .,respectively). After dividing the subjects by controls' median values ofexpression levels, we found a dose-dependent association between an increasedrisk of SCCHN and low expression levels of ERCC (adjusted OR, ., and %âCI:.-.; Ptrendâ =â.) and XPA (adjusted OR, .; %âCI, .-.;Ptrendâ =â.). We also identified a significant multiplicative interactionbetween smoking status and ERCC expression levels (Pâ=â.). Finally, afterintegrating demographic and clinical variables, we found that the addition ofERCC and XPA expression levels to the model significantly improved thesensitivity of the expanded model on SCCHN risk. In conclusion, reduced proteinexpression levels of ERCC and XPA were associated with an increased risk ofSCCHN. However, these results need to be confirmed in additional large studies."

Dose escalation used a traditional ""Â + "" design withstandard definitions of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and maximum tolerated dose.RESULTS: Of the  patients enrolled,  were evaluable for DLT and  wereevaluable for response. The maximum tolerated dose of the combination wasbuparlisib  mg daily and capecitabine  mg/m twice daily. DLTs includedgrade  hyperglycemia and grade  confusion. The most common grade  toxicitieswere diarrhea and elevation of aspartate aminotransferase and alaninetransaminase.

Low, detectable HIV RNA has been studied as a risk factor for adversehealth outcomes, but its clinical impact on cancer risk remains unclear. Theobjective of this study was to determine whether HIV RNA <, copies/mL sixmonths after starting therapy was associated with -year first cancer risk.METHODS: We followed , HIV therapy initiators from a US-based multicenterclinical cohort from  to . We used nonparametric multiple imputation toaccount for viral loads that fell below assay detection limits, and categorizedviral loads six months after therapy initiation into four groups: <, -,-, and > copies/mL. We calculated estimates of the cumulative incidenceof cancer diagnosis, accounting for death as a competing event. Inverseprobability of exposure and censoring weights were used to control forconfounding and differential loss to follow up, respectively.RESULTS: Crude -year first cancer risk in the study sample was .% (% CI:.%, .%), with the highest risk observed among patients with viral loadsbetween  and  copies/mL six months after ART initiation (.%). Aftercontrolling for baseline confounders, -year first cancer risk was .% (%CI: .%, .%), and was similar across viral load categories.CONCLUSION: Overall risk of first cancer was not associated with incomplete viralsuppression; however, cancer remains a significant threat to HIV patients aftertreatment initiation. As more HIV patients gain access to treatment in thecurrent ""treat all"" era, occurrences of incomplete viral suppression will beobserved more frequently in clinical practice, which supports continued study ofthe role of low-level HIV RNA on cancer development."
